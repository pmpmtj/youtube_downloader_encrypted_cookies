[0.16s] I am optimistic about artificial
[2.40s] intelligence in the long run. In the
[5.36s] short run, not so much. I'm afraid a lot
[8.96s] of companies have invested heavily into
[11.36s] immature artificial intelligence, mostly
[14.08s] large language models that will not
[16.32s] deliver a decent return on investment.
[18.88s] And it looks like this bubble is about
[21.04s] to burst. Today, I have a list of five
[24.16s] bad omens. The first bad omen of an AI
[27.68s] bubble bursting is multiple recent
[30.32s] reports that companies realize their AI
[32.88s] investments aren't paying off. The US
[35.76s] Census Bureau has reported for the first
[38.48s] time in two years that AI adoption has
[40.96s] been going down among US companies. This
[44.08s] follows briefly after a report from
[46.32s] MIT's project NAND that looked at the
[49.04s] implementation of generative AI and
[51.28s] global business. They found that 95% of
[54.16s] companies who've adopted the technology
[56.32s] have seen no measurable return on
[58.40s] investment. A recent report from
[60.24s] McKenzie likewise found that 80% of
[63.04s] companies have seen no positive impact
[65.60s] of using AI. The business analyst firm
[68.64s] Gartner has recently announced that
[70.72s] we're officially past peak AI hype and
[73.68s] in the trough of disillusionment. The
[76.24s] second bad omen is that people are
[78.64s] beginning to realize that even the best
[81.20s] current use case for AI coding isn't
[84.16s] living up to expectations. We talked
[86.16s] about this already last year. Multiple
[88.40s] studies have found that while AI
[90.64s] produces a lot of code quickly, it also
[93.12s] creates more mistakes and security
[95.44s] problems that need to be fixed down the
[98.24s] line. The newest study on the matter
[100.64s] comes from Meta, the model evaluation
[103.36s] and threat research group, which found
[105.68s] that large language models suck at
[108.40s] completing long tasks and actually make
[110.88s] developers slower. If you need any
[112.80s] indication that AI coding isn't panning
[115.12s] out, some software engineers are now
[117.68s] specializing in vibe coding cleanup.
[120.80s] This brings me to bad omen number three,
[123.76s] which are signs that AI overinvestments
[126.88s] are about to be corrected. Most of the
[129.68s] AI investment that's driven positive
[132.16s] stock trends has come from a few big
[134.32s] firms like Google, Alphabet, Meta or
[136.72s] Amazon. But as a recent report from
[138.56s] Goldman Sachs highlights, these
[140.88s] companies have tied up a lot of their
[143.28s] money in AI which can't continue. They
[146.08s] predict that AI investments by these
[148.40s] large companies are going to slow down
[150.72s] significantly in the near future and
[152.96s] expect that this reduction of investment
[155.36s] will generally diminish optimism for AI,
[158.80s] hence have a negative impact on the
[161.52s] stock market. The fourth bad omen is
[164.40s] public talk of an AI bubble and investor
[167.68s] retreat. Open AAI CEO Sam Alman has
[170.88s] recently acknowledged we're in an AI
[173.12s] bubble. He said in an interview with the
[175.12s] Verge, "Are we in a phase where
[177.12s] investors as a whole are over excited
[179.52s] about AI? My opinion is yes." And that
[182.80s] someone's going to get burnt there, I
[184.80s] think. Yes. Who might that someone be?
[187.20s] Certainly not those who have invested
[189.04s] into Alman's company, which recently
[191.28s] corrected its outlook and how much money
[193.36s] they'll burn until 2029, up by 90
[197.12s] billion. Indeed, Goldman Sachs analyst
[200.16s] Cash Rangan points out it's more of a
[202.64s] problem in private markets than in
[205.12s] public software names. By this, he means
[207.44s] that big companies such as Google and
[209.76s] Meta have invested heavily into AI for
[212.80s] sure, but they've also diversified as we
[216.48s] know that both have teams working on
[218.80s] going beyond large language models. Then
[221.84s] there is Martin Fimoski, a former
[224.72s] Reserve Bank of Australia economist and
[227.04s] AI researcher who just removed all AI
[230.24s] investments from his pension fund. He
[232.72s] cited concerns that many business
[234.88s] leaders misunderstand real AI
[237.04s] capabilities and that inflated
[239.12s] expectations mimic past bubbles. Fosski
[242.56s] said, "I don't think the majority of
[244.32s] businesses understand how to employ AI
[246.96s] and I don't think the majority of
[248.72s] managers understand what it is. The
[251.04s] business excitement around large
[252.80s] language models is far greater than the
[255.44s] actual usefulness. And my fifth and
[258.48s] final bad omen is that AI is hitting a
[261.28s] physical barrier that is data center and
[264.00s] energy supply shortages. In a recent
[266.32s] report, Goldman Sachs finds that data
[268.72s] center vacancy rates sit at a record
[270.88s] below 3% and near 0% in the most sought
[274.56s] after markets with new power at scale,
[276.96s] often not coming online until 2028 or
[280.00s] beyond. This is bad because it'll drive
[282.08s] up prices for model training. So much so
[284.80s] that many newcomers to AI will just be
[287.36s] cut off from progress, further worsening
[290.56s] the outlook. Personally, I think that
[292.88s] these are temporary obstacles and that
[295.04s] the impact in the next few years will be
[297.60s] limited because if I can see that
[299.76s] generative AI is the beginning and not
[302.40s] the end, I'm pretty sure investors can
[304.80s] see this too. But please don't take
[307.20s] financial advice from German physicists.
[309.92s] I've had bad experiences with that.
[312.56s] Whether it's literature research,
[314.56s] graphic design, or tax forms, there's
[317.44s] really no way around PDFs. I used to
[320.80s] hate working with PDFs, but my life has
[323.92s] become so much better since I've started
[326.64s] using UPDF, who've been sponsoring this
[329.44s] video. This app can really save you a
[332.08s] lot of time with PDFs. You can edit text
[334.88s] and images in documents directly,
[337.20s] highlight and comment and convert PDFs
[340.00s] to Word, PowerPoint, Excel, or images.
[342.80s] You can also merge or split files,
[344.96s] compress them, or encrypt them. And yes,
[347.44s] it syncs across all your devices. Their
[350.48s] AI assistant is where it gets really
[352.96s] clever. You can chat with your PDFs,
[355.84s] summarize long reports, compare several
[358.64s] documents side by side, or translate
[361.20s] them. You can even automatically create
[363.76s] mind maps, and they now have a brand new
[366.56s] feature that's an AI paper search that
[369.44s] finds credible references instantly.
[372.32s] Perfect if you don't want to spend hours
[374.88s] hunting citations. UPDF works on all
[378.24s] platforms and comes at 16th the cost of
[382.08s] Adobe. It's well worth it and all you
[385.68s] have to do is use the link in the
[387.92s] description to download it now and make
[390.88s] your PDF smarter today.
[394.48s] Thanks for watching. See you tomorrow.
