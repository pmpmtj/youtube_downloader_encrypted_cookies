They predict that AI investments by these large companies are going to slow down significantly in the near future and expect that this reduction of investment will generally diminish optimism for AI, hence have a negative impact on the stock market. The fourth bad omen is public talk of an AI bubble and investor retreat. Open AAI CEO Sam Alman has recently acknowledged we're in an AI bubble. He said in an interview with the Verge, \"Are we in a phase where investors as a whole are over excited about AI? My opinion is yes.\" And that someone's going to get burnt there, I think. Yes. Who might that someone be? Certainly not those who have invested into Alman's company, which recently corrected its outlook and how much money they'll burn until 2029, up by 90 billion. Indeed, Goldman Sachs analyst Cash Rangan points out it's more of a problem in private markets than in public software names. By this, he means that big companies such as Google and Meta have invested heavily into AI for sure, but they've also diversified as we know that both have teams working on going beyond large language models. Then there is Martin Fimoski, a former Reserve Bank of Australia economist and AI researcher who just removed all AI investments from his pension fund. He cited concerns that many business leaders misunderstand real AI capabilities and that inflated expectations mimic past bubbles. Fosski said, \"I don't think the majority of businesses understand how to employ AI and I don't think the majority of managers understand what it is. The business excitement around large language models is far greater than the actual usefulness. And my fifth and final bad omen is that AI is hitting a physical barrier that is data center and energy supply shortages. In a recent report, Goldman Sachs finds that data center vacancy rates sit at a record below 3% and near 0% in the most sought after markets with new power at scale, often not coming online until 2028 or beyond. This is bad because it'll drive up prices for model training. much that many newcomers to AI will just be cut off from progress, further worsening the outlook. Personally, I think that these are temporary obstacles and that the impact in the next few years will be limited because if I can see that generative AI is the beginning and not the end, I'm pretty sure investors can see this too. But please don't take financial advice from German physicists. I've had bad experiences with that. Whether it's literature research, graphic design, or tax forms, there's really no way around PDFs.

    "timestamped_text": "[0.16s] I am optimistic about artificial\n[2.40s] intelligence in the long run. In the\n[5.36s] short run, not so much. I'm afraid a lot\n[8.96s] of companies have invested heavily into\n[11.36s] immature artificial intelligence, mostly\n[14.08s] large language models that will not\n[16.32s] deliver a decent return on investment.\n[18.88s] And it looks like this bubble is about\n[21.04s] to burst. Today, I have a list of five\n[24.16s] bad omens. The first bad omen of an AI\n[27.68s] bubble bursting is multiple recent\n[30.32s] reports that companies realize their AI\n[32.88s] investments aren't paying off. The US\n[35.76s] Census Bureau has reported for the first\n[38.48s] time in two years that AI adoption has\n[40.96s] been going down among US companies. This\n[44.08s] follows briefly after a report from\n[46.32s] MIT's project NAND that looked at the\n[49.04s] implementation of generative AI and\n[51.28s] global business. They found that 95% of\n[54.16s] companies who've adopted the technology\n[56.32s] have seen no measurable return on\n[58.40s] investment. A recent report from\n[60.24s] McKenzie likewise found that 80% of\n[63.04s] companies have seen no positive impact\n[65.60s] of using AI. The business analyst firm\n[68.64s] Gartner has recently announced that\n[70.72s] we're officially past peak AI hype and\n[73.68s] in the trough of disillusionment. The\n[76.24s] second bad omen is that people are\n[78.64s] beginning to realize that even the best\n[81.20s] current use case for AI coding isn't\n[84.16s] living up to expectations. We talked\n[86.16s] about this already last year. Multiple\n[88.40s] studies have found that while AI\n[90.64s] produces a lot of code quickly, it also\n[93.12s] creates more mistakes and security\n[95.44s] problems that need to be fixed down the\n[98.24s] line. The newest study on the matter\n[100.64s] comes from Meta, the model evaluation\n[103.36s] and threat research group, which found\n[105.68s] that large language models suck at\n[108.40s] completing long tasks and actually make\n[110.88s] developers slower. If you need any\n[112.80s] indication that AI coding isn't panning\n[115.12s] out, some software engineers are now\n[117.68s] specializing in vibe coding cleanup.\n[120.80s] This brings me to bad omen number three,\n[123.76s] which are signs that AI overinvestments\n[126.88s] are about to be corrected. Most of the\n[129.68s] AI investment that's driven positive\n[132.16s] stock trends has come from a few big\n[134.32s] firms like Google, Alphabet, Meta or\n[136.72s] Amazon. But as a recent report from\n[138.56s] Goldman Sachs highlights, these\n[140.88s] companies have tied up a lot of their\n[143.28s] money in AI which can't continue. They\n[146.08s] predict that AI investments by these\n[148.40s] large companies are going to slow down\n[150.72s] significantly in the near future and\n[152.96s] expect that this reduction of investment\n[155.36s] will generally diminish optimism for AI,\n[158.80s] hence have a negative impact on the\n[161.52s] stock market. The fourth bad omen is\n[164.40s] public talk of an AI bubble and investor\n[167.68s] retreat. Open AAI CEO Sam Alman has\n[170.88s] recently acknowledged we're in an AI\n[173.12s] bubble. He said in an interview with the\n[175.12s] Verge, \"Are we in a phase where\n[177.12s] investors as a whole are over excited\n[179.52s] about AI? My opinion is yes.\" And that\n[182.80s] someone's going to get burnt there, I\n[184.80s] think. Yes. Who might that someone be?\n[187.20s] Certainly not those who have invested\n[189.04s] into Alman's company, which recently\n[191.28s] corrected its outlook and how much money\n[193.36s] they'll burn until 2029, up by 90\n[197.12s] billion. Indeed, Goldman Sachs analyst\n[200.16s] Cash Rangan points out it's more of a\n[202.64s] problem in private markets than in\n[205.12s] public software names. By this, he means\n[207.44s] that big companies such as Google and\n[209.76s] Meta have invested heavily into AI for\n[212.80s] sure, but they've also diversified as we\n[216.48s] know that both have teams working on\n[218.80s] going beyond large language models. Then\n[221.84s] there is Martin Fimoski, a former\n[224.72s] Reserve Bank of Australia economist and\n[227.04s] AI researcher who just removed all AI\n[230.24s] investments from his pension fund. He\n[232.72s] cited concerns that many business\n[234.88s] leaders misunderstand real AI\n[237.04s] capabilities and that inflated\n[239.12s] expectations mimic past bubbles. Fosski\n[242.56s] said, \"I don't think the majority of\n[244.32s] businesses understand how to employ AI\n[246.96s] and I don't think the majority of\n[248.72s] managers understand what it is. The\n[251.04s] business excitement around large\n[252.80s] language models is far greater than the\n[255.44s] actual usefulness. And my fifth and\n[258.48s] final bad omen is that AI is hitting a\n[261.28s] physical barrier that is data center and\n[264.00s] energy supply shortages.

This is bad because it'll drive\n[282.08s] up prices for model training. So much so\n[284.80s] that many newcomers to AI will just be\n[287.36s] cut off from progress, further worsening\n[290.56s] the outlook. Personally, I think that\n[292.88s] these are temporary obstacles and that\n[295.04s] the impact in the next few years will be\n[297.60s] limited because if I can see that\n[299.76s] generative AI is the beginning and not\n[302.40s] the end, I'm pretty sure investors can\n[304.80s] see this too.
